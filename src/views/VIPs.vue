      <dl>
        <dt>How many members will there be?</dt>
        <dd>
          We're keeping it very limited to start, less than 5. We will grow
          slowly to keep quality high.
        </dd>
        <dt>What is expected?</dt>
        <dd>
          Mostly just enthusiasm. If you are interested in voice/accessibility
          technology and want to get involved, the LipSurf VIPs program is a
          great opportunity.
        </dd>
        <dt>What if I become too busy to contribute?</dt>
        <dd>
          No worries! The program isn't a job. It's just an opportunity to build
          your skillset and audience within the a11y (accessibility) and voice
          ecosystems.
