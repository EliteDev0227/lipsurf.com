                            Can I use my subscription on multiple computers or devices?

                        <v-expansion-panel-content>
                            Yes. You may install LipSurf on multiple personal computers (up to 6) and sign-in with the same LipSurf account associated with your subscription.

                        <v-expansion-panel-header>What if the price goes up and I'm already subscribed?</v-expansion-panel-header>
                        <v-expansion-panel-content eager>It's likely the subscription price will increase in the future as new features are added. When it happens, we will "grandfather" you in your plan â€” meaning we will honor the previous, lesser price for you.</v-expansion-panel-content>

                        <v-expansion-panel-header>How can I save money on my plan?</v-expansion-panel-header>
                        <v-expansion-panel-content eager>If you subscribe for a year upfront you can save 25% (equivalent to 3 free months).

                        <v-expansion-panel-content eager>A wake word is like "OK Google" or "Alexa" that allows you to turn on LipSurf without clicking the extension button, instead you can turn on LipSurf completely hands free. 
                            The wake word is <span class="voice-cmd">Hey LipSurf</span>.
